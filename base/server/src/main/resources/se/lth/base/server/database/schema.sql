-- Example table containing some data per user, you are expected to remove this table in your project.
CREATE TABLE foo(
    -- First the four columns are specified:

    foo_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    -- foo_id is the first column with type INT. This is used to uniquely identify each foo. In this way, the foo can be
    -- deleted or updated by referring only to its foo_id. The AUTO_INCREMENT keyword is H2 specific and indicates
    -- that the column is supplied with a default value that is incremented for each row. The first row
    -- will automatically get foo_id = 1, the second one will get foo_id = 2, and so on.

    payload VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    -- payload is the second column with type VARCHAR. This is the data that is typed in the input field
    -- on the foo tab in the front end. There is no limit to how long the string can be.
    -- NOT NULL specifies that the row must have a payload.

    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    -- user_id is the third column with type INT. This keeps track of who the user is, so that each user has their own
    -- foos only.

    created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() NOT NULL,
    -- created is the fourth and final column with type TIMESTAMP. This column also has a default value
    -- which is created by the function CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() if not supplied during creation.

    -- Here are some additional constraints that the data must relate to:

    PRIMARY KEY(foo_id),
    -- This defines foo_id as the unique identifier of the table. It adds NOT NULL to the column and
    -- enforces that the values rows all have a unique identifier.

    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    -- This informs that the column user_id is a relation to another table's primary key. In combination
    -- with the NOT NULL constraint above it is not possible to enter data that is not connected to a user.
    -- Note that there can be multiple rows with the same user_id (but the foo_id is unique for each row).
    -- The ON DELETE CASCADE ensures that when a user is deleted then all their foo data will also be deleted.
